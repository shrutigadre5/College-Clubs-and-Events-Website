# College-Club-Website

Website is the best way for publishing information and branding an organisation. So, I have designed a website to give a brief idea to the fresher's about the different clubs and their events that take place in our college. For designing the website, HTML,CSS and JavaScript along with SQL are being implemented efficiently. In addition to this, I have taken help from many online web designing and developing tools. In this website, I have provide information about how the college as an organisation supports these various clubs. The various clubs established in our college are: 
1. PASC (PICT ACM Student Chapter) 
2. PISB (PICT IEEE Student Branch) 
3. PCSB (PICT CSI Student Branch) 
4. DEBSOC (Debate Society) 
5. PNAB (Pict Newsletter And Brochure) 
6. TEDx 
7. Robotics Club
8. PICT MUN (Mock United Nations) 
9. Art Circle

The website has been made in such a way that anyone can get an overview about the club events. In future, the implementation of this project will be for all the students of PICT and they'll be one step closer to getting to know their college in a better way.
