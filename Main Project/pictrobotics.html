<h1> PICT ROBOTICS  </h1> </u><br>
<div class="robotics-info"> At the Pune Institute of Computer Technology (PICT), PICT Robotics stands as a beacon of innovation and exploration for students passionate about robotics. Established to nurture curiosity and foster a deep-seated interest in robotics beyond academic boundaries, PICT Robotics provides a platform for students to delve into real-life applications of their knowledge, learn cutting-edge technologies, and participate in prestigious national-level competitions. </div> <br><br>

<div class="robotics-info"><center><b><u>Founding Principles and Mission</u></b></center>
    PICT Robotics was founded with a visionary mission to cultivate a vibrant robotics culture among students by providing them with opportunities to explore, innovate, and excel in the field. The club aims to inspire students to push the boundaries of their academic learning and engage in hands-on projects that apply theoretical knowledge to practical solutions in robotics.</div><br><br>

<div class="robotics-info"><center><b><u>Key Activities and Initiatives</u></b></center>
    PICT Robotics engages students through a variety of activities and initiatives aimed at enhancing their robotics skills, fostering creativity, and preparing them for competitive environments.<br><br>

<div class="robotics-info"><center><b>Hands-On Projects</b></center>
One of the cornerstone activities of PICT Robotics is engaging students in hands-on robotics projects. These projects range from basic explorations in robot construction and programming to advanced applications in autonomous systems, artificial intelligence, and mechatronics. Students work in teams to brainstorm ideas, design prototypes, write code, and test their robots in simulated and real-world scenarios.<br><br>

<div class="robotics-info"><center><b>Workshops and Training Sessions</b></center>
To complement hands-on learning, PICT Robotics organizes workshops and training sessions conducted by industry experts and alumni. These sessions cover a wide range of topics, including robotics fundamentals, advanced programming languages (like C++, Python), sensor integration, machine learning for robotics, and ethical considerations in robotics design. Workshops are designed to equip students with practical skills and theoretical knowledge necessary for tackling complex robotics challenges.<br><br>

<div class="robotics-info"><center><b>Participation in Competitions</b></center>
PICT Robotics actively encourages students to participate in national-level robotics competitions. Competitions provide students with a platform to apply their skills, showcase their innovative projects, and compete against peers from other institutions. Competitions range from line-following robots and maze-solving challenges to more sophisticated tasks involving human-robot interaction, swarm robotics, and industrial automation. Participation in competitions fosters teamwork, resilience, and problem-solving skills among students.<br><br>
