<h1> PICT MUN </h1> </u><br>

<div class="mun-info">PICT MUN Club, established in 2016, consists of a group of inquisitive students who are passionate about social, political and economic issues that elude the future of our world. PICT MUN strongly believes in the important role of dialogue and discussion in solving any problem and hence always abides by its motto - 'Think.Discuss.Prosper.' PICT MUN organizes an annual MUN conference and various public speaking events to engage the youth, who are the torchbearers of the future, in stimulating conversations. </div> <br><br>

<div class="mun-info"><b><center><u>The Founding Vision</u></center></b>
PICT MUN was founded with a clear mission: to cultivate an environment where students can engage deeply with global issues through the lens of diplomacy and international relations. The club emphasizes the importance of dialogue and discussion as tools for problem-solving and consensus-building. The motto, 'Think.Discuss.Prosper.', encapsulates the core values of PICT MUN, highlighting the belief that informed discourse and collaboration are essential for addressing complex challenges facing our world today.</div><br>

<div class="mun-info"><b><center><u>Key Activities and Initiatives</u></center></b>
PICT MUN engages students through a variety of activities and initiatives designed to enhance their understanding of international affairs and develop their skills in diplomacy and public speaking.<br><br>

<b><center>Annual MUN Conference</center></b>
The centerpiece of PICT MUN's activities is its annual Model United Nations conference. This simulation of the United Nations allows participants to assume the roles of diplomats representing different countries and debate on current global issues. The conference follows formal UN procedures, including drafting resolutions and negotiating agreements. Participants research their assigned country's policies, prepare position papers, and engage in lively debates to find diplomatic solutions to real-world challenges.<br>

<b><center>Public Speaking Events</center></b>
In addition to the MUN conference, PICT MUN organizes public speaking events throughout the year. These events include debates, panel discussions, and speaker series on topics ranging from geopolitics to sustainable development. Public speaking workshops are also conducted to help participants refine their communication skills, articulate their ideas effectively, and build confidence in expressing their viewpoints.<br><br>
