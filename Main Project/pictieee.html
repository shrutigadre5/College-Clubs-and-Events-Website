<h1>PICT IEEE STUDENT BRANCH </u> </h1> <br>
<div class="ieee-info"> The Institute of Computer Technology (PICT) IEEE Student Branch (PISB) has been a cornerstone of technical education and professional development since its inception in 1988. With a mission to inculcate a deep sense of technical awareness among its student members, PISB has continuously strived to stay at the forefront of technological advancements. Through a variety of events, initiatives, and programs, PISB has created a dynamic environment for students to explore, learn, and innovate in the field of technology.</div> <br><br>

<div class="ieee-info"><b><center><u>Founding and Mission</u></center></b>
    The PICT IEEE Student Branch was established with the primary goal of fostering a sense of technical curiosity and proficiency among its members. The founders envisioned a platform where students could transcend traditional classroom learning and engage in hands-on, experiential learning. This vision has guided PISB's activities and initiatives for over three decades, making it a respected and influential entity within the PICT community.<br><br>

    &nbsp;<u>PISB's mission encompasses several key objectives:</u><br>

&nbsp;1. To enhance the technical knowledge and skills of its members. <br>
&nbsp;2. To provide a platform for students to stay updated with the latest technological trends.<br>
&nbsp;3. To promote innovation, creativity, and research among students.<br>
&nbsp;4. To encourage collaboration and networking with industry professionals and other IEEE branches.<br>
&nbsp;5. To support the professional and personal development of its members.<br><br><br>

<div class="ieee-info"><b><center><u> Major Events: Credenz and Credenz Tech Dayz</u></center></b>
    One of the most significant contributions of PISB to the student community is the organization of two major annual events: Credenz and Credenz Tech Dayz. These events have become flagship activities, drawing participation from students across various institutions and disciplines.<br><br>
    
    <b><center>Credenz</center></b>
    Credenz is a grand technical festival that showcases the talent and ingenuity of students. This event includes a wide array of competitions, workshops, seminars, and guest lectures. It serves as a platform for students to demonstrate their skills, compete with peers, and learn from industry experts.<br>
    
    Competitions at Credenz cover various domains, including coding, robotics, electronics, and more. These competitions not only challenge the participants' technical acumen but also promote teamwork, problem-solving, and critical thinking. Workshops and seminars held during Credenz provide insights into cutting-edge technologies and industry practices, helping students stay abreast of the latest developments in their fields.<br><br>
    
    <b><center>Credenz Tech Dayz</center></b>
    Credenz Tech Dayz is another major event organized by PISB, focusing specifically on emerging technologies and their applications. This event features intensive workshops, hackathons, and technical talks. The hackathons, in particular, provide a collaborative environment where students can work on real-world problems and develop innovative solutions.<br>
    
    Credenz Tech Dayz also emphasizes skill development through practical sessions on topics such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain, and cybersecurity. By participating in these sessions, students gain hands-on experience and valuable insights that complement their academic learning.<br><br>
